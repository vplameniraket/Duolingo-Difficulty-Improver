## Project description

Meet Duolingo Difficulty Improver â€” a must-have for those who strive to get the most from their studying process! <b>It hides the sentence in your target language so that you would concentrate on your auditory comprehension of the language. You can also hover the sentence, and it will become revealed so that you could both read it out loud and study visually. Thus, both verbal, visual and audial ways of studying languages are put to use.</b> Great, right?

Around 60% of all Duolingo exercises are aimed at translation from your target language to your native language. The task is quite plain and works little on one's language comprehension skills, isn't it? The idea of combining translation and listening comprehension was what inspired this magic userstyle, which makes it possible to work more on developing your listening abilities at ease.

Do not hesitate and check out this nice userstyle :) Feel free to hit me up via <b>enyodauk@gmail.com</b> if you have any suggestion or notes.
